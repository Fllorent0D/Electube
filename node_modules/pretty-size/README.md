# How to :

Pretty-size package allows you to convert size from **bytes** to **human readable size** .




## 1. Procedural Way:

```js

       const psize=require('pretty-size');

       psize(454434343)
         //'433.4 MiB'
       psize(454434343,true)
         //'454.4 MB'
       psize(134343,true)
         //'134.3 kB'
       psize(1024*1024)
         //'1.0 MiB'
       psize(1024*1024*1024*1024,true)
         //'1.1 TB'
       psize(1024*1024*1024*1024,false)
         //'1.0 TiB'

```

## 2. Oriented-Object Way (OOP) :

```js

         require('pretty-size');
          (454434343).prettySize();
          //'433.4 MiB'
          (454434343).prettySize(true);
          // //'454.4 MB'  
```
